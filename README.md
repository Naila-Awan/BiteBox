# BiteBox
"BiteBox" is a food delivery website with 4 user roles: customers, restaurants, riders, and admins. Customers browse local restaurants, add dishes to their cart, and place orders. Restaurants manage menus and receive orders. Riders deliver orders. Admins oversee accounts and handle rider payments. The project uses HTML, CSS, and ASP.NET with C#.
